# OARS: The Open Age Ratings Service
The Open Age Ratings Service allows free and commercial software to generate the OARS XML required for the AppData file. OARS relies on honest answers from upstream projects and is purely informational. The original set of questions was been inspired by the now-defunct [TIGRS](http://web.archive.org/web/20120110101954/http://www.tigrs.org/?page=ratings).

### System Vendors
Some software may be restricted in certain regions and vendors can control the apps presented to users.

### End Users
Parents and responsible adults can make informed choices before installing software for children.

### Developers
Creating the required AppStream XML markup is 100% free and no payment is required to any certification company.
